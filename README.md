# üè¢ Active Directory Blue Team Lab with Splunk, Sysmon & Attack Simulation

This project is a hands-on lab environment built to simulate a small enterprise network. It includes an Active Directory domain, logging infrastructure using Splunk and Sysmon, and an attacker machine for red-team-style simulations. The goal is to build detection skills, understand log flows, and practice offensive/defensive security techniques in a contained environment.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Set up a working AD domain with DNS
- Configure endpoint logging with Sysmon
- Forward logs to Splunk using Universal Forwarder
- Simulate common attacks and analyze detection patterns
- Document the setup, configurations, and attack paths

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used

- **Sysmon** ‚Äì Endpoint telemetry
- **Splunk + UF** ‚Äì Log collection and SIEM
- **BloodHound** ‚Äì AD recon
- **CrackMapExec** ‚Äì Lateral movement & enumeration
- **Impacket** ‚Äì Credential attacks (e.g., Pass-the-Hash, DCSync)
