# 🧠 Active Directory Virtual Lab with Splunk & Kali Linux

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to set up a multi-VM enterprise-like environment using Oracle VirtualBox. The core of the lab is built around Active Directory, with additional components like a Splunk server for event logging and a Kali Linux machine for security testing. The lab is designed for learning, experimentation, and security monitoring in a controlled environment.
---
## 🎯 Objectives
- Simulate a real-world enterprise environment using virtual machines.
- Deploy and configure Active Directory services.
- Monitor network and host-based events using Splunk.
- Create and manage domain users at scale.
- Conduct basic penetration testing using Kali Linux.


## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

### 🖥️ Hardware Requirements
- **RAM:** 16 GB (allocated across all VMs)  
- **Disk Space:** 250 GB (not fully utilized but reserved for scalability and VM snapshots)  
- **CPU:** Quad-Core or better recommended  
- **Host OS:** Windows/Linux/macOS with VirtualBox installed

### 🔧 Virtual Machines Setup
- **Windows Server 2019**: Active Directory Domain Controller  
- **Windows 10 Pro**: Target machine to join the domain  
- **Kali Linux**: Used for simulating attacks  
- **Splunk (Ubuntu Pro)**: Centralized event monitoring and logging  

## ⚙️ Installation & Configuration

### ✅ Virtual Machine Creation
All virtual machines were created using Oracle VirtualBox.  
**Tip:** Always verify the integrity of downloaded installation files using checksum hashes.

Example command (PowerShell on Windows):
`Get-FileHash .\Downloads\filename.iso`  
Compare the output with the official hash provided on the download website.

### 💡 Network Configuration
Static IP configuration was applied to the Ubuntu-based Splunk server using Netplan.  
👉 See detailed config: [`network-config.yaml`](#)

## 🏗️ Active Directory Deployment

### 🖥️ Domain Controller Setup (adlab.local)
- Installed Windows Server 2019.
- Promoted the server to a domain controller.
- Configured services:
  - **Active Directory Domain Services**
  - **DNS**
  - **DHCP**
  - **RAS/NAT**

### 🧑‍💼 Bulk User Creation
Used a PowerShell script to generate over **1000 user accounts** in Active Directory.  
👉 Script source: [`powershell-script.ps1`](/scripts/powershell-script.ps1)

## 🧩 Client Configuration

The Windows 10 Pro client machine was:
- Assigned a static IP address and DNS pointing to the domain controller
- Joined to the domain via system settings

## 📊 Splunk Server & Logging

- Splunk Enterprise was installed on Ubuntu Pro for centralized log collection.
- Forwarded logs from Windows Server using Splunk Universal Forwarder.
- Monitored Active Directory-related events and suspicious activity in real time.

## 🧪 Security Simulation (Kali Linux)

Kali Linux was used to simulate attack scenarios:
- Network scans (e.g., Nmap)
- Authentication probing
- Lateral movement within the domain

Logs and behaviors were monitored in Splunk to assess detection capability.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### 1. 🖥️ Virtual Machine Not in Fullscreen
**Fix:** Install VirtualBox Guest Additions from the device menu inside each VM.



### 2. 🧭 Splunk GUI Not Displayed on Ubuntu Server
To display the Splunk web GUI:
- Install a desktop environment using `ubuntu-desktop`
- Open firewall for port 8000



### 3. 🖧 Domain Join Failures
- Ensure DNS is pointed to the domain controller
- Confirm that system clocks are synchronized
- Restart DNS service or reboot client if needed


### 4. 🌐 Static IP Assignment for Splunk
- Used Netplan for IP configuration  
👉 See: [`network-config.yaml`](#)
